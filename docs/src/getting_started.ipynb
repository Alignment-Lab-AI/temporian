    "## Part 1: Events and EventSets\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic unit of data in Temporian is an **event**. An event consists of a timestamp and a set of feature values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Events are not handled individually. Instead, events are grouped together into an **[`EventSet`][temporian.EventSet]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`EventSets`][temporian.EventSet] are the main data structure in Temporian, and represent **[multivariate and multi-index time sequences](../user_guide/#what-is-temporal-data)**. Let's break that down:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"multivariate\" indicates that each event in the time sequence holds several feature values.\n",
    "- \"multi-index\" indicates that the events can represent hierarchical data, and be therefore grouped by one or more of their features' values.\n",
    "- \"sequence\" indicates that the events are not necessarily sampled at a uniform rate (in which case we would call it a time \"series\").\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an [`EventSet`][temporian.EventSet] from a pandas DataFrame, NumPy arrays, CSV files, and more. Here is an example of an [`EventSet`][temporian.EventSet] containing four events and three features (one of which is used as an `index`):"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You now have the basic concepts needed to create a data preprocessing pipeline with Temporian:\n",
    "- Defining an **EventSet** and using **operators** on it.\n",
    "- Combine **features** using **select** and **glue**.\n",
    "- Coverting data back and forth between Temporian's **EventSet** and pandas **DataFrames**.\n",
    "- Visualizing input/output data using **EventSet.plot()**.\n",
    "- Operating and plotting with an **index**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other important details\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep it short and concise, there are interesting concepts that were not mentioned above:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check the [**Time Units** section of the User Guide](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/#time-units). There are many [**calendar operators**](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/temporian/operators/calendar/calendar_day_of_month/) available when working with datetimes.\n",
    "- To combine or operate with events from different sampling sources (potentially non-uniform samplings) check the [**sampling** section of the User Guide](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/#sampling).\n",
    "- Temporian is **strict on the feature data types** when applying operations, to avoid potentially silent errors or memory issues. Check the [User Guide's **casting** section](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/#casting) section to learn how to tackle those cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- The [**Recipes**](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/recipes/) are short and self-contained examples showing how to use Temporian in typical use cases.\n",
    "- Try the more advanced [**tutorials**](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/) to continue learning by example about all these topics and more!\n",
    "- Learn how Temporian is **ready for production**, using [**graph mode**](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/#eager-mode-vs-graph-mode) or [Apache Beam](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/temporian_with_beam/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- We could only cover a small fraction of **[all available operators](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/temporian/operators/add_index/)**.\n",
    "- We put a lot of ❤️ in the **[User Guide](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/)**, so make sure to check it out 🙂."
