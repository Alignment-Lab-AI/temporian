    "## What is temporal data?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Temporian, there is only one type of data: **multivariate multi-index time sequences** (MMITS). MMITS extends many commonly used data formats such as time-series and transactions to allow multi-variate data, non-uniform sampling, non-aligned sampling, and hierarchically-structured data. In that, MMITSs are particularly well suited to represent classical time-series, but also transactions, logs, sparse events, asynchronous measurements, and hierarchical records.\n",

    "## Events and EventSets\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of data in Temporian is referred to as an _event_. An event consists of a timestamp and a set of feature values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of an event:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "timestamp: 2023-02-05\n",
    "feature_1: 0.5\n",
    "feature_2: \"red\"\n",
    "feature_3: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Events are not handled individually. Instead, events are grouped together into `EventSets`. When creating one, it is convenient to put similar features together and to sort them according to the timestamps in increasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of an `EventSet` containing four events and three features:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "timestamp: [04-02-2023, 06-02-2023, 07-02-2023, 07-02-2023]\n",
    "feature_1: [0.5, 0.6, NaN, 0.9]\n",
    "feature_2: [\"red\", \"blue\", \"red\", \"blue\"]\n",
    "feature_3:  [10, -1, 5, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remarks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- All values for a given feature are of the same data type. For instance, `feature_1` is float64 while `feature_2` is a string.\n",
    "- Operators handle the value NaN (for _not a number_) as missing (e.g., it's ignored in moving averages).\n",
    "- Timestamps are not necessarily uniformly sampled.\n",
    "- The same timestamp can be repeated.\n",
    "- Timestamps can be floating point numbers (in seconds) that don't represent a datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next code examples, variables with names like `evset` refer to an `EventSet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an `EventSet` as follows:"

A common example of leakage is _label leakage_, which involves the invalid use of labels in the model input features. Leakage tends to bias model evaluation by making it appear much better than it is in reality. Unfortunately, leakage is often subtle, easy to inject, and challenging to detect.\n",
