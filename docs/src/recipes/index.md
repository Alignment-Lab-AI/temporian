# Recipes

Recipes are short and self-contained examples showing how to use Temporian
in typical use cases.

## Aggregate events by timestamp

| Recipe                                                                                                |

| [Aggregate events by calendar features (month/year)](aggregate_calendar.ipynb) |
| [Aggregate events by fixed-length intervals (turn events into time-series)](aggregate_interval.ipynb) |
| [Aggregate events from different indexes](aggregate_index.ipynb)                                      |
| [Unify events with identical timestamps](aggregate_duplicated.ipynb)                                  |

## Split EventSets
