**Temporian** is a Python package for **feature engineering of temporal data**, focusing on providing a **simple and powerful API**, a first-class **iterative development** experience, **efficient and well-tested implementations** of common and not-so-common temporal data preprocessing functions, and **preventing common modeling errors**.

## Â¿Why Temporian?

Temporian helps you **focus on high-level modeling**.

Temporal data processing is commonly done with generic data processing tools. However, this approach is often tedious, error-prone, and requires engineers to learn and re-implement existing methods. Additionally, the complexity of these tools can lead engineers to create less effective pipelines in order to reduce complexity. This can increase the cost of developing and maintaining performant ML pipelines.

To see the benefit of Temporian over general data processing libraries, compare the original **Feature engineering** section of our [Khipu 2023 Forecasting Tutorial](https://github.com/tryolabs/khipu-2023), which uses pandas to preprocess the M5 sales dataset, to the [updated version using Temporian](example/m5_competition.py).

## Installation

Temporian is available on PyPI. To install it, run:

```shell
pip install temporian
```

## Minimal end-to-end example

```python
import temporian as tp

# Load data.
evset = tp.read_event_set("path/to/temporal_data.csv", timestamp_column="time")
node = evset.node()

# Apply operators to create a processing graph.
sma = tp.simple_moving_average(node, window_length=tp.days(7))

# Run the graph on the input data.
result = sma.evaluate(evset)
```

## Key features

These are what set Temporian apart.

- **Simple and powerful API**: Temporian exports high level operations making processing complex programs short and ready to read.
- **Prevents modeling errors**: Temporian programs are guaranteed not to have future leakage unless the user calls the `leak` function, ensuring that models are not trained on future data.
- **Iterative development**: Temporian can be used to develop preprocessing pipelines in Colab or local notebooks, allowing users to visualize results each step of the way to identify and correct errors early on.
- **Efficient and well-tested implementations**: Temporian contains efficient and well-tested implementations of a variety of temporal data processing functions. For instance, our implementation of window operators is **x2000** faster than the same function implemented with NumPy.
- **Wide range of preprocessing functions**: Temporian contains a wide range of preprocessing functions, including moving window operations, lagging, calendar features, arithmetic operations, index manipulation and propagation, resampling, and more. For a full list of the available operators, see the [operators documentation](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/temporian/core/operators/).

## Documentation

## For developers

### Environment Setup

Dependencies are managed through [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). To
install Poetry, execute the following command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

You can verify Poetry was correctly installed by executing:

```shell
poetry --version
```

The environment requires Python version 3.9.0 or greater to be installed. We
recommend using [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) to install
and manage multiple Python versions. To install PyEnv, head over to the tool's
[documentation in Github](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) and follow the
installation instructions for your operating system.

Once PyEnv is installed, you can download any Python version (e.g. 3.9.6) by
running:

```shell
pyenv install 3.9.6
```

After both Poetry and an adequate Python version have been installed, you can
proceed to install the virtual environment and the required dependencies.
Navigate to the project's root directory (where the `pyproject.toml` file is
located) and execute:

```shell
poetry install
```

You can also install the environment in the project's root directory by
executing `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` before it.

Finally, activate the virtual environment by executing:

```shell
poetry shell
```

### Testing

Install bazel and buildifier (in Mac we recommend installing bazelisk with brew):

```shell
brew install bazelisk
```

Run all tests with bazel:

```shell
bazel test //...:all
```

You can use the Bazel test flag `--test_output=streamed` to see the test logs in realtime.

### Benchmarking and profiling

Benchmarking and profiling of pre-configured scripts is available as follow:

#### Time and memory profiling

```shell
bazel run -c opt benchmark:profile_time -- [name]
bazel run -c opt benchmark:profile_memory -- [name] [-p]
```

where `[name]` is the name of one of the python scripts in
[benchmark/scripts](benchmark/scripts), e.g. `bazel run -c opt benchmark:profile_time -- basic`.

`-p` flag displays memory over time plot instead of line-by-line memory
consumption.

#### Time benchmarking

```shell
bazel run -c opt benchmark:benchmark_time
```

### Running docs server

Live preview your local changes to the documentation with

```shell
mkdocs serve -f docs/mkdocs.yml
```
