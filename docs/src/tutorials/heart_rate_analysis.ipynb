    "In this notebook, we will explore how to use Temporian to load, visualize, and process medical data. Our main goal is to create a Temporian program that can detect heartbeats and calculate both the heart rate and heart rate variability from raw [ECG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography) signals.\n",

    "To do this, we will use the ECG and respiratory waveforms data of three patients from the [Apnea-ECG](https://www.physionet.org/content/apnea-ecg/1.0.0/) vital sign dataset, which is available on the [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/) repository. We will load this data into Temporian using the [WFDB](https://wfdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) python package, which is a widely used tool for working with physiological signals."
